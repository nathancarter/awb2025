# Using AI in Python through HuggingFace Transformers

This repository contains materials for the AI workshop I delivered at the 2025 Analytics Without Borders conference at Bentley University.

 - Exercise 1: Browse the [HuggingFace models list](https://huggingface.co/models) and find:
    - at least one model category that you recognize and know what it means
    - at least one model category that you donâ€™t recognize and would like to know what it means
 - Learn about new model categories at [HuggingFace > Docs > Tasks](https://huggingface.co/tasks)
 - Exercise 2: FLUX.1-dev by Black Forest Labs
    - [FLUX.1-dev model card](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev)
    - [Online interface](https://huggingface.co/spaces/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev) (in HuggingFace Spaces)
